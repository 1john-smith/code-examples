 5	## You can use this file to change the default behaviour of wget or to
 6	## avoid having to type many many command-line options. This file does
 7	## not contain a comprehensive list of commands -- look at the manual
 8	## to find out what you can put into this file.
 9	## 
10	## Wget initialization file can reside in /etc/wgetrc
11	## (global, for all users) or $HOME/.wgetrc (for a single user).
12	##
13	## To use the settings in this file, you will have to uncomment them,
14	## as well as change them, in most cases, as the values on the
15	## commented-out lines are the default values (e.g. "off").

19	## Global settings (useful for setting up in /etc/wgetrc).
20	## Think well before you change them, since they may reduce wget's
21	## functionality, and make it behave contrary to the documentation:

24	# You can set retrieve quota for beginners by specifying a value
25	# optionally followed by 'K' (kilobytes) or 'M' (megabytes).  The
26	# default quota is unlimited.
27	#quota = inf
28	
29	# You can lower (or raise) the default number of retries when
30	# downloading a file (default is 20).
31	#tries = 20
32	
33	# Lowering the maximum depth of the recursive retrieval is handy to
34	# prevent newbies from going too "deep" when they unwittingly start
35	# the recursive retrieval.  The default is 5.
36	#reclevel = 5
37	
38	# Many sites are behind firewalls that do not allow initiation of
39	# connections from the outside.  On these sites you have to use the
40	# `passive' feature of FTP.  If you are behind such a firewall, you
41	# can turn this on to make Wget use passive FTP by default.
42	#passive_ftp = off
43	passive_ftp = on
44	
45	# The "wait" command below makes Wget wait between every connection.
46	# If, instead, you want Wget to wait only between retries of failed
47	# downloads, set waitretry to maximum number of seconds to wait (Wget
48	# will use "linear backoff", waiting 1 second after the first failure
49	# on a file, 2 seconds after the second failure, etc. up to this max).
50	waitretry = 10

54	## Local settings (for a user to set in his $HOME/.wgetrc).  It is
55	## *highly* undesirable to put these settings in the global file, since
56	## they are potentially dangerous to "normal" users.
57	##
58	## Even when setting up your own ~/.wgetrc, you should know what you
59	## are doing before doing so.

62	# Set this to on to use timestamping by default:
63	#timestamping = off
64	
65	# It is a good idea to make Wget send your email address in a `From:'
66	# header with your request (so that server administrators can contact
67	# you in case of errors).  Wget does *not* send `From:' by default.
68	#header = From: Your Name <username@site.domain>
69	
70	# You can set up other headers, like Accept-Language.  Accept-Language
71	# is *not* sent by default.
72	#header = Accept-Language: en

74	# You can set the default proxies for Wget to use for http and ftp.
75	# They will override the value in the environment.
76	#http_proxy = http://proxy.yoyodyne.com:18023/
77	#ftp_proxy = http://proxy.yoyodyne.com:18023/

83	# binary, mega and micro.
84	#dot_style = default
85	
86	# Setting this to off makes Wget not download /robots.txt.  Be sure to
87	# know *exactly* what /robots.txt is and how it is used before changing
88	# the default!
89	#robots = on

91	# It can be useful to make Wget wait between connections.  Set this to
92	# the number of seconds you want Wget to wait.

95	# You can force creating directory structure, even if a single is being
96	# retrieved, by setting this to on.
97	#dirstruct = off

99	# You can turn on recursive retrieving by default (don't do this if
100	# you are not sure you know what it means) by setting this to on.
101	#recursive = off
102	
103	# To always back up file X as X.orig before converting its links (due
104	# to -k / --convert-links / convert_links = on having been specified),
105	# set this variable to on:
106	#backup_converted = off
